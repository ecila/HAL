            <b>Call for Proposals</b>

            <p>The third International Conference on Live Interfaces will be held on June 29th - July 3rd 2016 at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. The conference will bring together people working with live interfaces in the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, dance, puppetry, robotics or games.</p>

            <p>2016 International Conference on Live Interfaces website: <a href="http://www.liveinterfaces.org">http://www.liveinterfaces.org</a></p>

            <p>The conference scope is highly interdisciplinary but with a focus on interface technologies of expression in the area of performance. Topics of liveness, immediacy, presence (and tele-presence), mediation, collaboration and timing or flow are engaged with and questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role contemporary media technologies play in human expression.</p>

            <p>We hope to accept work which will create a space of multiplicity, in order to investigate how disciplinary concerns inform different but overlapping approaches to interface design. The conference consists of paper presentations, performances, interactive installations, poster demonstrations, a doctoral colloquium and workshops. Works engaging with the principles and assumptions governing interaction design, including perspectives from art, philosophy, product design and engineering are specially invited.</p>

            <p>We welcome submissions that address critical and reflective approaches to key themes in the design and use of live interfaces. A wide range of approaches are encouraged by people from all possible backgrounds. The submission categories are the following:</p>

            <p><b>Papers</b></p>

            <p>4-6 pages. We are interested in submissions that address the conference topics listed below. The papers must consist of an original contribution to the field of artistic interfaces, cite prior related work, and demonstrate a rigorous research methodology. Paper authors may additionally present their work in the demo session.</p>

            <p><b>Posters/Demos</b></p>

            <p>2-4 pages. These are shorter artistic demonstrations of work or concepts. Space will be provided for posters and tables for demoing work. A link to an online video is required for posters and demos.</p>

            <b><p>Doctoral Colloquium</b></p>

            <p>1-4 pages. The doctoral colloquium will be an opportunity for researchers to present work and meet other doctoral students working in related fields, to discuss current research and approaches to practice-based research, and receive guidance from more experienced researchers. The day will include a session of short presentations in the morning, a symposium in the afternoon, and a short workshop in live interfaces in the early evening, finishing with food and drinks in the Digital Humanities Lab.</p>

            <b><p>Performances, Installations and Workshops</b></p>

            <p>The submission format for these is a one-page description of the work, a link to online examples of the work, and a technical rider. These can written in the Latex or Word templates provided. The proposals will address how live interfaces are part of the work and identify which conference theme and topics the proposal relates to. Please describe the relevance to the ICLI conference and specify the duration of the work. The proposal should also include a 100 word biography and a picture.</p>

            <p>The papers (including posters and demos) will have an ISBN number and have a DOI.</p>

            <p>All submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed, single-blind, with three reviewers per paper, using the EasyChair conference management system.</p> 

            <p>Please use the template provided on the website for your submission.</p>
