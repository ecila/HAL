    <h2><b>International Conference on Live Interfaces</b></h2>
    
    <p><b>Call for Proposals</b></p>

    <p>The third International Conference on Live Interfaces will be held on June 29th - July 3rd 2016 at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. The conference will bring together people working with live interfaces in the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, dance, puppetry, robotics or games.</p>

    <p>The conference website: <a href="http://www.liveinterfaces.org">http://www.liveinterfaces.org</a></p>

    <p>The conference scope is highly interdisciplinary but with a focus on expressive interface technologies for performance. Topics of liveness, immediacy, presence (and tele-presence), mediation, collaboration and timing or flow are engaged with and questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role that contemporary media technologies play in human expression.</p>

    <p>We hope to accept work which will create a space of multiplicity, in order to investigate how disciplinary concerns inform different but overlapping approaches to interface design. The conference consists of paper presentations, performances, interactive installations, poster demonstrations, a doctoral colloquium and workshops. Works engaging with the principles and assumptions governing interaction design, including perspectives from art, philosophy, product design and engineering are especially welcome.</p>

    <p>We invite submissions that address critical and reflective approaches to key themes in the design and use of live interfaces. A wide range of approaches are encouraged by people from all possible backgrounds. The submission categories are the following:</p>

    <p><b>Papers</b></p>

    <p>5-8 pages. We are interested in submissions that address the conference topics listed below. The papers must consist of an original contribution to the field of artistic interfaces for live performance, describe its context, and demonstrate a rigorous research methodology. Paper authors may additionally present their work in the demo session.</p>

    <p><b>Posters/Demos</b></p>

    <p>3-6 pages. These are shorter artistic demonstrations of work or concepts. Space will be provided for posters and tables for demoing work. A link to an online video is required for posters and demos.</p>

    <b><p>Doctoral Colloquium</b></p>

    <p>2-6 pages describing current work. The doctoral colloquium will be an opportunity for researchers to present their work and meet other doctoral students in related fields, to discuss current research and approaches to practice-based research, and receive guidance from more experienced researchers. The day will include a session of short presentations in the morning, a symposium in the afternoon, and a short workshop in live interfaces in the early evening, finishing with food and drinks in the Digital Humanities Lab.</p>

    <b><p>Performances, Installations and Workshops</b></p>

    <p>2-4 pages. Proposals should clearly articulate how the work or workshop develops the design, use or conceptualisation of live interfaces as related to one or more of the conference themes and should comprise: a) A description of the work (including duration), b) an image (where appropriate), c) a link to online examples of the work, d) a 150-word biography for each collaborator, and e) a technical rider (with stage layout, audiovisual setup, equipment to be provided by the conference). Daytime and evening performances will be in concert hall venues on campus, and club performances will be in two live music venues in Brighton. Please indicate what setting would best suit the work. Installation proposals should include description of the space and set-up time required. Workshops proposals should specify the duration and number of people that can be accommodated. Workshops and installations will be located in spaces across the University of Sussex campus.</p>
    
    <p>Technical specifications of venues are available on request.</p>

    <p>The proceedings will be published online in collaboration with <a href="http://reframe.sussex.ac.uk/reframebooks/" target="_blank">REFRAME Books</a> (MFM, University of Sussex). They will be Open Access, with Creative Commons attribution, and with an ISBN number. Each individual paper will receive a <a href="http://www.doi.org" target="_blank">Digital Object Identifier</a> (DOI).</p>

    <p>We are looking forward to receive your submission!</p>
