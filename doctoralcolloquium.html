    <h2><b>International Conference on Live Interfaces</b></h2>
    
    <p><b>Doctoral Colloquium: Call for Proposals</b></p>

    <p><b>NOTE: Extension of Deadline: February 21st! - Due to popular demand, we have decided to extend the submission deadline for ALL CATEGORIES until midnight February 21st.</b></p>

    <p>This is to let you know that the deadline for submissions for the Doctoral Colloquium of the 3rd International Conference on Live Interfaces (ICLI) to be held at the University of Sussex in Brighton this summer, has been extended until the 21st February.</p>
 
    <p>The colloquium will offer participants the opportunity to share nascent cutting-edge research in the interdisciplinary field of live interfaces. Researchers whose work involves live interfaces are encouraged to make a submission to give a paper, a demonstration, or a short performance. The colloquium is organised by Sussex doctoral researchers, with input from Sally Jane Norman, professor of performance technologies. The colloquium will serve as an ideal platform for practice based researchers to discuss research questions, methods, and get feedback on work-in-progress.</p>

    <p>The website for the conference (including the call) can be found here: <a href="http://www.liveinterfaces.org">http://www.liveinterfaces.org</a></p>

    <p>The third outing for this international conference builds on the successes of the previous two conferences. Doctoral researchers from a wide variety of disciplines will benefit from involvement with ongoing research presented on this world stage, and we are as interested in submissions from scientists and designers as from practitioners/artists.

    <p>The papers submitted will be part of the ICLI conference proceedings, published with an ISBN number (and a <a href="http://www.doi.org" target="_blank">Digital Object Identifier</a> (DOI)) by <a href="http://reframe.sussex.ac.uk/reframebooks/" target="_blank">REFRAME Books</a>. The proceedings from the last ICLI conference (2014 in Lisbon) can be found here: <a href="http://www.liveinterfaces.org/proceedings2014.html" target="_blank">http://www.liveinterfaces.org/proceedings2014.html</a>. 

    <p>Looking forward to receive your submissions,
    <br>Joe Watson, on the behalf of the ICLI Conference team.
