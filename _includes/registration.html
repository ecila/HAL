        <p>Early-bird registration ended on May 25th. The reduced fee was for students and the unemployed.</p>      
        
        The conference registration fee includes:<br>
        - Attendance to paper sessions, poster and demo sessions, concerts and keynotes<br>
        - Conference guide and electronic proceedings<br>
        - Lunch and coffee on all the days, as well as a conference dinner<br>

        <p>Please register for the conference through the <a href= "http://onlineshop.sussex.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> <strike>University of Sussex Online Shop: Conference Registration</strike></a> 
        </p>
       
        <p><b>NEW</b>: due to local interest in the event, we have decided to offer non-academic day passes for the conference, which makes it more feasible for the general public to participate in the conference. These tickets can be bought on the <a href= "http://onlineshop.sussex.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> <strike>University of Sussex Online Shop: Day Tickets</strike></a> 
        </p>

	      <p>Tickets for the <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/881852698627470/" target="_blank">Live Interfaces @ St. Mary's</u></a> and <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/138947953176866/" target="_blank">Live Interfaces @ Bleach</a></u> can be purchased on the door.</p>
    
    

        <p><b>Accomodation</b> is not included in the conference fee, but it is possible to book rooms on campus with <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/accommodation/holiday" target="_blank"><u>Residential Services</u></a>. Here, the minimum stay is 7 nights (but prizes can be quite low). Another option is to book accommodation through our partner <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/ICLI2016" target="_blank"><u>Visit Brighton</u></a> where you can find accommodation on campus and in the city. Yet another possibility is to find use the exhaustive<a href="http://www.bedandbreakfasts.co.uk/university-of-sussex/" target="_blank"> <u>Bed and Breakfasts</u></a> guide. 

        <p>Brighton is a very popular destination with tourists in the summer, so booking early is a good idea.</p>
