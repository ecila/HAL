        <p>Accomodation is not included in conference fees, but it is possible to book rooms on campus with <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/residentialservices/" target="_blank">Residential Services</a>. Here, the minimum stay is 7 nights (but prices as as low as £17 per night). A more appealing option might be to book accommodation through our partner <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/ICLI2016" target="_blank">Visit Brighton</a> where you can find accommodation on campus and in the city. Yet another possibility is to find accommodation through the <a href="http://www.bedandbreakfasts.co.uk/university-of-sussex/" target="_blank">Bed and Breakfasts</a> guide. 

        <p>Brighton is a very popular destination with tourists in the summer, so booking early is a good idea.</p>
