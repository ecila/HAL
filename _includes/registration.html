        <p>Accomodation is not included in conference fees, but we recommend booking on-campus rooms with <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/residentialservices/" target="_blank">Residential Services</a>, or if you would like to spend the night in the city, the <a href="http://www.bedandbreakfasts.co.uk/university-of-sussex/" target="_blank">Bed and Breakfasts</a> guide could be helpful in finding good prices.
