            <b>Stuart Nolan: Mindreading Interface Design</b><br>

            <br>A great deal of human communication is subconscious yet existing interfaces are designed for conscious communication. The emerging combination of Thought Identification Technologies, Robotics, and Cold Data Reading will change this, opening up new ways of working, learning, performing, and mucking about. 

            <br> Mindreading Interfaces will make interaction more responsive and playful but also more mysterious, illusory, opaque, and potentially insecure. What will Mindreading Designers need to consider?

            <br> We will need to consciously design for deception and illusion or we risk building it accidentally. To do this we need to understand Illusion Design as a discipline that extends far beyond the subtle tricks and sparkly boxes of the stage magician.

            <br><b>Biography</b>

            <br> Stuart Nolan is a performer and research magician working with Illusion Design and The Mindreading Web. His Mindreading Robotics, IdeoBird and OuijaBird, developed as Magician in Residence at Pervasive Media Studio and The University of Bristol, were featured in the BBC Click Christmas Special, The Guardian, and US Wired’s Connectivity 2.0. He later developed Robomancy (Fortune Telling Robotics) as part of the Being There project (being-there.org). 
            <br> A former NESTA Fellow in Applied Magic with a background in cell biology, interactive media, and experience design, he combines traditional disciplines of deception - conjuring, psychological and physiological illusion, memory feats, hypnosis, sideshow tradition - with bespoke technology and original research into how we are deceived by language, physical gesture, and technology.  

            <br> Stuart performs internationally and is currently touring his latest work, Season of Sleeps, which premiered at the 2015 Venice Biennale. He once deceived over 700 organisations just to prove a point.

            <b>Roman Paska: Fear of Puppetry</b><br>

            <br>A discussion of the trajectory of the puppet in art and society from the anti-puppet prejudice of the European Humanist tradition to the emergence of puppetry art as the defining performance mode of the 21st century. Will consider prevailing methods and techniques of performance with objects, and performance that is labeled "puppet theatre," with an emphasis on late 20th-century traffic between the puppet and related forms, including animation, digital theatre, performance art and filmmaking. Will address some key modalities of performance with objects and puppets: from performing the uncanny, performing in Plato’s cave, performing against nature, performing the gods, performing identity, performing the body (in parts), performing the (exquisite) corpse, performing the agon of objects and performing in tongues to performing annihilation. Will investigate the nature of the puppet and puppet identity, the problems of puppet space and the place of the body. Will interrogate existing notions and definitions of puppetry and consider how contemporary theories have evolved through new approaches to performance. Will examine current challenges facing the puppet-as-object in order to ask, “Is the future puppet theater?”
