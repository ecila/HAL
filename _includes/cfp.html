            <h2>Call for Papers and Projects</h2>

            <p>ICLI is an interdisciplinary conference focussing on the role of interfaces in all artistic performance activities. We encourage critical and reflective approaches to key themes in the design and use of live interfaces. A wide range of theoretical and practice based approaches are welcomed by people from all possible research or practice backgrounds. 
            </p>

            <h3>Conference Themes</h3>

		- New Performance Interfaces: prosthesis, extensions<br>
		- Human Computer interaction: human-machine relationships<br>
		- Automata, non-humans, AI: autonomy in artistic performance<br>
		- Space, sound, installations: performing with installations<br>
		- Theory, Digital Arts, Culture: Interface theory<br>
		- Computer games, game theory: gameplay as performance art<br>
		- Audiovisual and multimodal works: multimodal performances<br>
