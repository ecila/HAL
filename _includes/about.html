                Humanities researchers are opening their ears. From sound studies to oral history, media archaeology to ethnography, researchers are listening to the sonic environments of our lives, both off and online. The Humanising Algorithmic Listening (HAL) network will bring together experts from across the humanities, sociology, machine listening, critical theory philosophy and interactive computer music to develop a research agenda for the design and development of computational methods for audio analysis - listening algorithms - in the arts and humanities.

<p>
Existing methods are capable of tasks such as recognising melodies, identifying instruments or musical genres. Their power is evidenced by commercial IT products such as iPhone's Siri, which uses voice recognition software, or Spotify's recommender system that magically creates musical playlists based on our previous preferences. Driven by technical innovation and commercial interests, these tools are becoming at once more powerful, more complex and their inner workings more opaque. In order to support humanist research as tools for discovery, interpretation and insight, computational power must be accompanied by critical consideration of what it means to listen through algorithms, what new ways of listening might be afforded, and how we can learn to interact meaningfully with these black-boxed processes.

<p>
A rich philosophical literature examines the active role that technologies play in mediating our relationship with the world. These ideas have been considered in the context of interactive computer music, where software agents that listen and respond as musical partners have been created, but have yet to be thoroughly explored in the wider contexts of technologically-mediated listening. Developing a critical framework is crucial, firstly to underpin the design of new computational methods in arts and humanities - for example to support the interpretation and discovery of large audio archives and the design of new creative sound-based technologies. And secondly to deepen understanding of the role that these listening algorithms play in our everyday lives.
