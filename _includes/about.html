            <h2>Conference Theme</h2>

            <p>The third International Conference on Live Interfaces will take place at the University of Sussex in June, 2016. This biennial conference will bring together people working with live interfaces the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, dance, puppetry, robotics or games. The conference scope is highly interdisciplinary but with a focus on interface technologies of expression in the area of performance. Topics of liveness, immediacy, presence (and tele-presence), mediation, collaboration and timing or flow are engaged with and questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role contemporary media technologies play in human expression.</p>

            <p>Interfaces are material objects, even if screen-based, and their design relates to material resistance, fluidity, affordances, constraints, and expressive scope. We hope to accept work which will create a space of multiplicity, in order to investigate how disciplinary concerns inform different but overlapping approaches to interface design.
            </p>

            <p>The conference consists of paper presentations, performances, interactive installations, poster demonstrations, a doctoral colloquium and workshops. Works engaging with the principles and assumptions governing interaction design, including perspectives from art, philosophy, product design and engineering are specially invited. </p>
